# Random Forest

Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family. It is a powerful and versatile method that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The algorithm works by creating multiple decision trees during training and then combining their outputs to make predictions.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Random Forest works:

1. **Ensemble of Decision Trees:** Random Forest creates an ensemble of decision trees during the training phase. Each decision tree is built using a random subset of the training data and a random subset of features. This randomness helps to reduce overfitting and makes the model more robust.

2. **Bootstrapped Data:** For each decision tree, a random subset of the training data (with replacement) is used. This process is known as bootstrapping. As a result, some instances may appear multiple times in a tree's training data, while others may not appear at all.

3. **Random Feature Selection:** When splitting nodes in each decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered. This helps in reducing correlation among the trees and ensures that each tree makes decisions based on different subsets of features.

4. **Decision Tree Construction:** Each decision tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the selected features. The process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or having a minimum number of samples in each leaf node.

5. **Voting (Classification) or Averaging (Regression):** Once all the decision trees are trained, they collectively make predictions. For classification tasks, the mode of the class predictions from individual trees is taken as the final prediction. For regression tasks, the average of the individual tree predictions is considered as the final prediction.
