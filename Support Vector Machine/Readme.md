# Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. SVM is particularly effective in cases where the data is not linearly separable and can be extended to handle non-linear data through the use of kernels. SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes while maximizing the margin between the two classes.

Here's a high-level overview of how SVM works in machine learning for classification tasks:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Like with any machine learning algorithm, it is crucial to preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**: After preprocessing the data, we train the SVM model using the training dataset. The SVM model tries to find the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes. The hyperplane is chosen such that it maximizes the margin between the classes.

3. **Kernel Trick (for Non-Linear Data)**: In cases where the data is not linearly separable, SVM can be extended to handle non-linear data through the use of kernels. Popular kernel functions include polynomial kernels, radial basis function (RBF) kernels, and sigmoid kernels.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Once the SVM model is trained, we evaluate its performance using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: SVM has hyperparameters, such as the choice of the kernel, regularization parameter (C), and kernel-specific parameters (e.g., gamma for RBF kernel). Hyperparameter tuning is essential to find the best combination of hyperparameters that yield the best model performance.
