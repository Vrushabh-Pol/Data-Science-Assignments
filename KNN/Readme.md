# KNN
KNN stands for k-Nearest Neighbors, and it is a popular algorithm used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks. It is considered a supervised learning algorithm, meaning it learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm works as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**: First, you need to have a labeled dataset, where each data point is associated with a class label (for classification) or a numerical value (for regression). This dataset is used to train the model.

2. **Choosing k**: The "k" in k-Nearest Neighbors refers to the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction. It is a hyperparameter that needs to be set before training the model. Typically, the value of k is an odd number to avoid ties.

3. **Prediction Process**: When a new, unlabeled data point is presented to the model, the algorithm finds the k data points (neighbors) from the training dataset that are closest to the new data point in the feature space. The distance metric used (e.g., Euclidean distance) depends on the type of features and data being used.

4. **Majority Voting (Classification) or Averaging (Regression)**: For classification tasks, the algorithm assigns the class label to the new data point based on majority voting among its k-nearest neighbors. For regression tasks, it predicts the average of the target values of the k-nearest neighbors.

5. **Model Evaluation**: After training the model and making predictions on a test dataset, it's essential to evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.

KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm, but it can be computationally expensive for large datasets since it requires computing distances between the new data point and all other data points in the training set. Additionally, the choice of the appropriate k value and the distance metric can significantly impact the performance of the algorithm. Nevertheless, KNN can be a useful tool, especially for low-dimensional datasets and as a baseline algorithm for comparison with more complex models.
